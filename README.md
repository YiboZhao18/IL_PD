# IL_PD
This is a MJFF-funded project aimed to investigate the role of interleukin pathways in PD pathology. Key approaches include DEA (Differential Expression Analysis) on transcriptomics and proteomics data, eQTL and pQTL analysis, gene-phenotype association analysis and PRS (Polygenic Risk Score) calculation. This project is based on the PPMI cohort. 

# Backgroud
Neuroinflammation has a crucial role in the pathophysiology of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD), with growing evidence implicating interleukin-mediated pathways in both disease onset and progression. Our previous findings suggested that interleukin (IL) pathways, especially the IL-12 signalling pathway interacts with Mendelian PD-related genes such as LRRK2. This project aims to validate the hypothesis that IL pathway activity is associated with clinical manifestations of PD and that this impact differs between idiopathic and LRRK2-PD cases.

# 1. Acquire IL pathway gene/protein list
Genes/proteins involved in IL1, IL2, IL3/5, IL4/13, IL6, IL7, IL10, IL12, IL17, IL20 were derived from Reactome Pathway Database.

# 2. Differential expression analysis and association with PD symptoms
Whole blood transcriptomics and CSF proteomics data for healthy controls, idiopathic PD cases, LRRK2-PD cases and LRRK2-Prodromal cohorts were extracted from PPMI database. Transcript and protein levels of IL genes were compared between cases and control, adjusted by age, gender and disease duration. Significant signals were associated with motor and non-motor symptoms of PD patients at baseline and 3-year follow up.
