# IL_PD
This is a MJFF-funded project aimed to investigate the role of interleukin pathways in PD pathology. Key approaches include DEA (Differential Expression Analysis) on transcriptomics and proteomics data, eQTL and pQTL analysis, gene-phenotype association analysis and PRS (Polygenic Risk Score) calculation. This project is based on the PPMI cohort.
